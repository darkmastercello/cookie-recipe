            History
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In the early 1990s, English First Division clubs believed that a radical restructuring of football was
                needed if they and the game in general were to develop and flourish.</li>
            <li>So on 17 July 1991, they signed the Founder Members Agreement, establishing the basic principles for the
                setting up of the Premier League. </li>
            <li>The League would have commercial independence from the Football League and The FA, leaving it free to
                organise its own broadcast and sponsorship agreement.</li>
            <li>On 20 February 1992, the 22 First Division clubs resigned from the Football League en masse and three
                months
                later, on 27 May, the Premier League was established as a limited company.</li>
            <li>The inaugural Premier League campaign started on Saturday 15 August, 1992, with 22 clubs.</li>
            <li>When the Premier League was formed, there was always the intention to reduce the number of clubs to 20
                to
                promote development and excellence at club and international level.</li>
